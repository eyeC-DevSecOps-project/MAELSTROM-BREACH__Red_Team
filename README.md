Maelstrom-Breach is the **Red Team component** of the eyeC ecosystem. It is an **Adversary Emulation Engine** designed to stress-test the detection capabilities of Sentinel-Trace and the enforcement protocols of Sovereign-Shield.

Rather than simple scripts, Maelstrom uses structured **Campaigns** to simulate the lifecycle of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

## 🎯 Offensive Scope

Maelstrom-Breach automates multi-stage attacks mapped directly to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework:

* **Reconnaissance (T1595):** Automated service discovery and vulnerability probing.
* **Resource Hijacking (T1498):** Network-level DoS/DDoS simulation.
* **Initial Access (T1190):** SQL Injection and Web exploit delivery.
* **Command & Control (T1059.004):** Reverse shell orchestration and persistence.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The framework is built as a modular **C2 (Command & Control)** controller:

1. **The Controller (C++):** Orchestrates phases defined in JSON campaign files.
2. **The Exploit Engine:** Delivers cross-platform payloads (Python, Bash, C++).
3. **The Target Hub:** Manages a heterogeneous lab of vulnerable nodes (Metasploitable, Windows, Debian).

## 🧪 Validation Loop

Maelstrom-Breach is not a hacking tool; it is a **Validation Engine**. Its success is measured by how well it triggers the defense trilogy:

1. Maelstrom launches a "Storm-Front" campaign.
2. Sentinel-Trace correlates the kernel-level eBPF signals.
3. Sovereign-Shield isolates the target, effectively "killing" the Maelstrom session.

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
# Execute the full attack campaign
chmod +x launch_maelstrom.sh
./launch_maelstrom.sh
```
